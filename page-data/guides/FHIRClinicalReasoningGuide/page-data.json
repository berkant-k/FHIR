The quality measure and reporting space is being actively developed and changed and further development will be needed to keep up with standards. For example, both the [May2021 ballot](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/2021May/index.html) of the cqf- measures IG and the [Davinci Data Exchange for Quality Measures](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/davinci-deqm/datax.html) IG change some of the operations that were implemented here.\n\nThere was some prior work done on `ActivityDefinition/$apply` and `PlanDefinition/$apply` that are relevant to the clinical quality reporting space that were not integrated with this work yet and should be considered for next steps.\n\n## CPG Operations\n\nThe CPG IG defines operations that work directly with CQL either as ad-hoc queries via the `/$cql` operation or via Library resources stored in the FHIR Registry (`/Library/$evaluate` and `/Library/[id]/$evaluate`). These operations are exposed by the *optional* module operation/fhir-operation-cpg. In order to make these operations available to the server, you must build the fhir-operation-cpg module and copy the target/fhir-operation-cpg-X.X.X-shaded.jar into the userlib directory of your FHIR server installation.\n\n* /$cql\n* /Library/$evaluate\n* /Library/[id]/$evaluate\n\n# CQF Operations\n\nThe cqf-measures IG builds upon the resources and operations defined in the [FHIR Clincial Reasoning Module](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4B/clinicalreasoning-module.html) to define a workflow of operations that support electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) and reporting. These operations are exposed by the *optional* module operation/fhir-operation-cqf.
